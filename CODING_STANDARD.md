Coding Standard
=========

Any submission to this project should closely follow the
[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) coding guidlines.
To ensure a consistent format beyond PEP8, code should be linted with
[black](https://github.com/ambv/black), with lines can be up to 100
characters long.
